## Documentation

The native Windows, Linux and Mac OS X versions of `TagSpaces` are built with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/). Electron is an app runtime based on Chromium and node.js.

### How to run TagSpaces from the source code?
Install [node.js, npm](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](http://git-scm.org/) for your platform (e.g. OS X, Windows or Linux).

Install bower package manager

    $ npm install -g bower

Get the TagSpaces source code by cloning its repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tagspaces/tagspaces.git

Go to the data folder and install the TagSpaces extensions with bower:
    
    $ cd tagspaces && cd data
    $ bower install
    

#### Run the native Windows, Linux or Mac OS X application with Electron
* Install the `electron-prebuilt` package with this command: `npm install -g electron-prebuilt`
* Goto the folder: `cd tagspaces/data/`
* Execute one of the following commands `electron .` or `npm start`

#### Run the Chrome/Chromium extension
* Go to the chrome `Settings` and then to `Extension`
* Enable the `Developer mode` checkbox in the upper right part of the screen
* Click on the `Load unpacked extension...` button
* Then select the `tagspaces/data` directory and click `Open`
* Activate the `Allow access to file URLs` check box in the TagSpaces entry, in order to enable the access to your local file system
* Start the extension by clicking on the TagSpaces icon in the upper right part of Chrome/Chromium

#### Run the Firefox extension
* Download and install the Mozilla Addon SDK following this [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation)
* Start the SDK by executing `source bin/activate` in the Addon SDK folder
* Go to the your local tagspaces folder and run the following command, where the -p argument specifies some local firefox profile:


    cfx run -p /tmp/mozprofile

* Start the addon by clicking the TagSpaces icon in the upper right area of Firefox

#### How to start the WebDAV edition for testing?
There is a script called `webdavserver.js` located in the data/web , which can be started with:

    node data/web/webdavserver.js

or

    npm run webdav
    
    
This command will start a local node.js based WebDAV server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Open your browser and enter the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html
        
You will be prompted for user credentials, which are username: `demo` and password: `demo` and now you should be able to work with the WebDAV version of TagSpaces.

For setting up the WebDAV version on your server, please read [Self-hosted TagSpaces with WebDAV](http://docs.tagspaces.org/selfhosting.html) from our blogs.

The CLA is an agreement commonly used in major open source project, which aims at protecting all parties implied by a contribution : the contributor, the main code author, and above all, the community. The CLA model we have chosen basically tells the following : the contributionâ€™s copyright is shared between the contributor and the main author. This means each party can do whatever she want in term of relicensing with this contributed piece of code. This is important, because, if in the future, the author wants to change the license in something more in favor of the community, a singular contributor cannot block the process.
