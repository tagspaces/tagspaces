      <>
        <p>
          The TagSpaces project is completely supported by subscribers. We
          aren't paid through advertising or sharing data, so purchasing a Pro
          subscription will contribute to the further development of our core
          offering, TagSpaces Lite, and our browser extensions, which can all be
          accessed without a cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from that, you will be able to enjoy a lot of useful features,
          advanced search capabilities, perspectives for your files and folders,
          and geo-tagging. Several of these features will be highlighted in the
          following slides.

        This perspective allows each folder to be transformed into a Kanban
        board, with columns representing the subfolders of the current folder.
        Each file residing in the subfolders is then displayed as a tile and can
        be shifted, via drag and drop, between the columns. The columns
        themselves can be rearranged also with drag and drop. A built-in Trello
        import is included, where an exported Trello board can be imported into
        the current folder.

          The Mapique Perspective displays files and folders that have been
          tagged with geotags on a digital map. This perspective is also able to
          automatically extract geocoordinates from EXIF/IPTC data stored in
          JPEG files. OpenStreetMap is the default choice for the map, though
          other compatible map tile servers may be used.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          The PRO version of TagSpaces allows users to tag their files and
          folders with geolocation data. This feature can be useful for planning
          trips or simply for privately annotating maps.

          A key feature of document management systems is the ability to create
          revisions of the edited files. This feature can be enabled in the
          Advanced tab of the application's Settings dialog box. Once activated,
          a full copy of the current file (e.g. TXT, MD, HTML or JSON) is
          created with each save.

          The auto-save feature can be enabled individually for each editable
          file. When it is enabled, the application will save any changes you
          make automatically. You can also save the file manually by clicking
          the save button or by pressing the CTRL+S key combination.
